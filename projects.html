<h3>3.Boosting Independent Component Analysis (2021) .<a href="./BoostingICA/BoostingICA.pdf">paper</a>.</h3>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Abstract—Independent component analysis is intended to recover the mutually independent components from their linear
mixtures. This technique has been widely used in many fields, such as data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning.
To alleviate the dependency on prior knowledge concerning unknown sources, many nonparametric methods have been
proposed. In this paper, we present a novel boosting-based algorithm for independent component analysis. Our algorithm
consists of maximizing likelihood estimation via boosting and seeking unmixing matrix by the fixed-point method. A variety
of experiments validate its performance compared with many of the presently known algorithms.</p>

<h3>2.Second-order Approximation of Minimum Discrimination Information in Independent Component Analysis (2021).<a href="./MDIICA/MDIICA.pdf">paper</a>.</h3>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Abstract—Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is intended to recover the mutually independent sources from their linear
mixtures and FastICA is one of the most successful ICA
algorithms. Although it seems reasonable to improve the performance of FastICA by introducing more nonlinear functions
to the negentropy estimation, the original fixed-point method
(approximate Newton method) in FastICA usually degenerates
under this circumstance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
novel method based on the second-order approximation of min-
imum discrimination information (MDI). Our method consists
of the joint maximization between the maximization of MDI via
weighted least squares and the estimation of unmixing matrix
by the fixed-point method. Simulations validate its efficiency
compared with other popular algorithms.</p>

<h3>1.Boosting in Univariate Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (2020~2021).<a href="./BoostingNPMLE/BoostingNPMLE.pdf">paper</a>.</h3>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Abstract—Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation is
intended to infer the unknown density distribution while making
as few assumptions as possible. To alleviate the over parameteri-
zation in nonparametric data fitting, smoothing assumptions are
usually merged into the estimation. In this paper a novel boosting-
based method is introduced to the nonparametric estimation
in univariate cases. We deduce the boosting algorithm by the
second-order approximation of nonparametric log-likelihood.
Gaussian kernel and smooth spline are chosen as weak learners
in boosting to satisfy the smoothing assumptions. Simulations and
real data experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
approach.</p>

<h3>2.Improvements of tuning parameter selection in slowness-time-correlation (STC) method for array acoustic logging (2019).</h3>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Background—During the petroleum exploration, the acoustic wave signals are obtained by multiple array acoustic logging tool. The recorded data are the convolutive
mixtures of different component waves (P, S, Stoneley), whose slowness-time (the reciprocal of sound velocities) are important in determining the oil and gas reservoirs. Althought slowness-time-correlation (STC)
is the most popular method to estimate the slowness-time of different component waves, it suffers from the difficult choices of tuning parameters. In this project, several improvements are proposed to alleviate
this problem: 1. Determine the approximate range of tuning parameters firstly by discrete randon transform (DST); 2. Supposing the correlation function is unimodal, golden section search is used to acquire the accurate
tuning parameter. 3. Apply the STC method with the given tuning parameters.</p>

Right: The collected signals in multiple (8) channels are the convolutive mixtures (with time delay) of different component waves.
The goal of our method is to estimate the slowness-time (the reciprocal of sound velocities) of different component waves via the multiple channel data. </p>

<h3>1. The SoC design of the acoustic signal acquisition system in multiple array acoustic logging tool.(member 2018~2019).</h3>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Background—Considering the high temperature environment in petroleum exploration, an acoustic signal acquisition system is designed based on the low-power Microsemi SoC. 
My duties are consisted of two parts:  C programming in ARM and VerilogHDL programming in FPGA. I programmed the scheduler of acoustic signal processing system and the design of sensor peripherals in ARM. Then I implemented several drivers via state machines in FPGA, 
such as Analog to Digital Coverter (AD7609), APB buscommunication (SRAM, interrupt, handshake protocal), measuring temperature module (TMP112), and EDIB (MIL-STD-1553) data bus.</p>
